# LeetCode DSA Practice Repository

## Overview
This repository contains my daily LeetCode problem-solving journey. I follow structured playlists such as Blind 75, NeetCode patterns, and topic-wise DSA progression. Each solution includes clean code, explanation, and complexity analysis.  

## Why This Repo Exists
To keep track of my daily practice, stay consistent, improve problem-solving skills, and maintain a clean portfolio of DSA solutions that I can revisit anytime.

## Structure
- Problems are organized by topics such as:
  - Arrays
  - Strings
  - Two Pointers
  - Sliding Window
  - Stack and Queue
  - Linked List
  - Trees
  - Graphs
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Backtracking
- Each problem folder contains:
  - The problem name
  - Explanation or comments
  - Time and space complexity
  - Final Java code

## How I Solve Each Problem
- Read the problem twice to understand the constraints
- Find the pattern (sliding window, two pointers, hashing, DP, recursion etc.)
- Write the brute force solution
- Optimize the solution
- Add comments explaining:
  - Why a loop is used
  - Why a data structure is chosen
  - Possible edge cases
  - Complexity analysis

## Study Plan Followed
1. Arrays and Strings  
2. Sliding Window  
3. Two Pointers  
4. Hashing  
5. Stack and Queue  
6. Linked List  
7. Trees and Binary Search Trees  
8. Graphs (BFS, DFS, Shortest Path)  
9. Recursion and Backtracking  
10. Dynamic Programming
